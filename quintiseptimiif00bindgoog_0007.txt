ΪΝ preparing this edition of 'Tertullicn’s A'pology I
h'ave endeavoured to meet the wants of young theo-
logieal studente ond to supply such notes es it seemed

i ⁸ likely would prove helpful to them in their stud'y of'a

text confessedly difficult in style andeb0unding in refer·
enees mythological, philosophicaL historicas, and legal.
In respect of' style Tertullien is often his own best
interpreter, end references will ,bc found in the notes
to pmoll'el‘ uses of words ond constructione in hie other
writings which should be corefully compared. For the
sake of convenience the composite text pn'nted in Migne’s
Potrologio Latine, vol. i‘. (Paris, 1844) hee been made
the basis of the present· edition, but ull the important
variant readings heve, I hope, been noticed, while some
of them heve been preferred t'o the text. An account ψ
of the manuscripts of Tertullian’s writings is given in

the Introduction to the first volume of Oehler’s edition, ¹

and some remarks upon the same subject will be found
in the Prefooe to the volume of Tertullien in the Librery
of the Fethers (Oxford, 1854).

I heve 'thought it better not to overburden the notes
with the names of authorities, but I wish to teke this
opportunity of ncknowledging my obligations to Oehler,
Bonwetsch‚ Kaye, Hamack, the commentatore in Migne,
end the earlier authors quoted and referred to by these
