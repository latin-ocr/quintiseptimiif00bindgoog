cir. xxv] adversus Gen'tes pro Christianis· 95

ferendi imperii tenent potestatem, cum ipsi regnarent, a
quibus acceperant eam gratiamt quem coluerat Saturnus 01
Jupiterl aliquem opinor Sterculium [sed Romae postea]‚
crim indigenis suis. Etiamsi qui non regnarunt, tamen
regnabatur ab aliis nondum cultoribus 01110, ut qui nondum5
dii habebantur. Ergo aliorum est regnum dare, quia regna·
batur 11111110 01110 quam isti dii inciderentur.

Sed quam vanum est fastigium Romani nominis religio·
sitatis meritis deputare, cum poet imperium sive adhuc

a Numa concepta est curiositas superstitiosa, nondum tamen

reignedl Whom did your gods once worship? Some sterculius, I
suppose, in 01110110 be honoured at Rome. Even if some 01 the gods
did 1101 reign, yet therei were rulers who did not' worship them,
simply because they did not then exist as'gods. It 10 1101 therefore
in the power of your gods 10 001101 empire, 101 empireo existed prior
to them.'‘ ·

3. [sed Romae postea] The MSS. vary and the passage 10 pro-
bably corrupt. The meaning is that some Romen god like Sterculius
had 10 be afterwards nonomedby the gods 01 Rome (in order to win
the worship 01 the Romans> alongwith their own native deities, who
had previously conferred sovereignty upon them elsewhere.

7. inciderentur: ‘were inscribed,' as gods on their statues and
images. Oomp. ch. 50, ‘statuas defunditis et imagines inscribitis et
titulos inciditis?

8. Sed quam vanum est. Another point 10 now taken up: ‘the
grandeur of your empire cannot be the reward of your religione
scrupulosity, for your elaborate religion is 01 10101 growth than your
empne?

fastigium ... deputare : ‘to attribute the dignity 01 the Roman
name to the (1000110 01 piety ’; see notes on deputare, 011. 20, 11.

10. Nam etsi 0 Numa. This is another argumentum od homiaem.

The wealth 01 religione ceremonial in Tertullian's day is urged 00
0 proci 01 greater piety than existed in the early days of Rome, when
the worship of the gods was conducted in a humbler style. Tertullian
is not seriously arguing that the depth of national pietyis proportioned
1ο the nationsl wealth; though as a matter of 1001 where wealth and
piety 0001101, the necessary forms by which the latter 10 expressed
will naturally be embellished by the former. Comp. Cic. de oct. deor.

11. curiositas. A rare word r it 10 used de 11100000. fraer. 7, ‘nobis
curiositate opus non 001 post Christum Jesum'; and u. 14, 1111110
