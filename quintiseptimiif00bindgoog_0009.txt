Tnarunnsn (Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus)
was born in Carthago of heathen parentage about 160 nn.
The exact date of his birth aud the names oi his parents
are unknown, but his father, we learn from S. Jerome ¹,
filled the office oi a proconsular centurion, and without
doubt he provided ior his sou a liberal education. That
Tertullian as a youth did not fail to make use of his
advantages is abundantly manifest from the strikingly wide
range of allusion aud reference noticeable iu his works,
and particularly in the Avonam, nn rannro, and nn
coronal. Eusebius (Η. Ε. ii. a) speaks oi his intimate
knowledge oi Roman law and of his reputatiou as a Latin
writer⁸ ; and the statement oi Trithemius (dc script. acas.)
that Tertullian was for many years'a distinguished rheto-
rician at Carthago seems intrinsically probable. Certainly
his learning aud powerful intellect, combined with his
brilliant and incisive eloquence, compelled the admiration
of men like S. Jerome, S. Augustius, and avissent of
Lerins⁴.
