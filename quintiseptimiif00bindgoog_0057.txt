uos e contrario edimus protectorem, si litterae M. Aurelii
gravissimi imperatoris requirantur, quibus illam Germanicam

word must be equivaleut to oppressorem, persecutorem. So again the
verb, ch. ²9, ‘eos debellatis qui eam sciunt petere!

1. protectorem. This seems e strange title by which to designate
Marcus Aurelius, but for the purposes oi the present argument it was
convenient for Tertullian to ignore the fearful persecutione which
befel the Christiana in this emperor’s reignt see the Introduction,
p. xv. Still, Aurelius was not personally a pereeomor iu the sense
in which ap. Decius was; yet the question remeius, ch came euch
a men to unctior persecution at alli See Merirale Hier. Rosa. viii.

appreoiate the Christian character.

presentation on the Antonine column, which attributes the shower to
the beneficence of Jupiter Pluvius3 and as being opposed to the general
polioy oi Amulius towards the Christiana. Mosheim suggests that
Tert. was thinking oi the rescript of Antoninus Pius to the Assembly
oi Asia, Euseb. iv. 13; but, as there given, the decree is spurious.
See a full discussion of'the subject in Lightfoot ignatius i. pp. 469-476,
and the article Legio Futrae'aatrie, with an engreving oi the Ant.
