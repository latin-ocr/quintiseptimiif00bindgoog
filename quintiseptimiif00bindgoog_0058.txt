tutique pessimi ab optimis quibusque, ut ab aemulis, quam a
suis sociis eradicandi judicarentur.

1. quas OEratanus ex perte frustratus. However illogical the
decision of Trajan might be in striot law (above, ch. 2) its ruling was
on the whole genereus towards the Christiana. Christianity had
always been illegal: Trajan reaffirmed the fact, but forbade ite pro-
fessors to be sought out or to be anonymously aoeused, They were
regarded as criminals, but placed in a better position than ordinary
criminals.

a. Hadrianus. Hadrian, the dilettante philosopher and art-patron,
issued a rescript (preserved by J nstin Martyr Apol. i. 90, and quoted
by Euseb. iv. 8, 9) in aa). 124, of similar purport to the letter oi lhajan
to Pliny. It was addressed to Minucius Fundanus the proconsul ot
Asia, and was intended to secure for the Ohristians a formal trial and
to protect them froin slanderoua informare.

quanquam curiositatum, ete. On the inquisitiva and versatile
character of Hadrian see Spartian. Hadr. 1, 2, 13 ff; Aurel. Victor
uper. 143 Eutrop. viii. 73 Euseb. H. Ε. v. 5. See Merivale Hist.
Rom. viii. 182 ff.
. 3. Vespasianus. Early Christian authors are unanimous in as-

' serting that no persecution was directed against the Christiana by
' , Vespasian (ab. 69-79) or by his son Titus (79—81). Oomp. Euseb.
iii. 17, Δεύτερος [te. Domitian] δῆτα τὸν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἀνεκίνει διωγμόν,
καίπερ τοῦπατρὸς αὐτοῦ Οὐεσπασιανοῦ μηδὲν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἄτοπον ἐπινοή-
usuros

4. Pius. Antoninus Pius (a.n.138-161) is generally admitted to
have shown a leniency to tha tunsum which was an advance upon
the action oi Hadriam but his edicte to the people of Larissa, Tbessa·

lonica, Athens, and to the Greeks generally, in iavour of the Christiana ⁴

mentioned by Melite of Sardis (apud Euseb. iv. 26), are not extant.

Aurelius Medea i. 6 ς Capitol. Aac. Pisa a, 7.

Verus. Elther Lucius Verus, who may have taken no part in
the persecuting policy of his eolleague, or Marcus Aurelius Verus
himself, whose attitude towards the Christiana Tertullian so strangely
misrepresents; see note above, protectorem. ‘Severus’ is the reading
of the Paris MS.

impressit. soal. ‘sanctioned’ ‘put into operation’ The me·

taphor is probably taken from sending, and therefore countenancing
with one’s authority.
