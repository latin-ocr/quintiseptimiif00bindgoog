1. The date cf Tertullisn's conversion bas been variously
placed between the years 185 aad 196¹. The earlier year
acccrds with the words cf S. J erome, eam aeque od mediam
caraem presbyter Ecclesiae pervenenisset, which may be
understood to imply a somewhat lengthy presbyterato} but
it dces not appear likely that a man of Tertullian's polemieal
real would have remained silent for twelve years—and the
Aronoer annot be dated earlier thau 197-before lifting

Npt' many years could have passed, however, before he was
attracted by the opinions cf Montanus aad bis ready pen

time cf Marcus Aurelius, and many passages seem ιο preclude the
supposition' The dates suggested by Prot. Harnack for the facts οι
Tertullian’s life are: Birth eir. 150; Conversion while at Rome cir.
190-195; Settled at Cartbage and wrote Apology,197; Attracted by
Montanism, eoa-2033 Open breach with the Ghurch, acy-208.
