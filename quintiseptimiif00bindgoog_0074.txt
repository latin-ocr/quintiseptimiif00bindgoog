¹ Duos, inquitis, non colitis, et pro imperatoribus sacrificia
non impenditis. Sequitur ut eadem ratione pro aliis nen
sacrificemus, quia nec pro nobis ipsis, semel deos non colendo.
Itaque sacrilegii et majestatis rei convenimur. Summa haec

6. Deos, inquitis, non colitis. Tertullian now takes up the two ἶ
main charges brought against the Christiana, Sacrilego and Disloyalty.
The consideration of the first accusation occupies ch. 10-27; of the
second ch. 28-38. The charge of sacrilege was based upon the grounds
that the Christiana neglected the prescribed worship of the gods, and
that they had no templss or sacrifices: comp. Lactant. ii. 2 ; Min
· Felix 103 and the sentence under which S. cyprian was condemned,
Acta procem. 4, ‘diu sacrilega mente vixisti . . . et inimicum te diis
Romanis et sacris legibus constituisti.'
y. pro aliis non sacrificemus. Tertullian is referring to sacrifices
in the heathen conception of them: elsewhere hc agrees with all the
early Fsthers in regarding the Holy Eucharist as the Christian Sacri-
fice: de crat. 19 pass.; de coaltfem. ii. 11, ⁴ sacrificium offertur, aut
Dei verbum administratur'3 comp. J ustin Mart dial. c. Tryphae
see Sesamos in Dici. etr. Ant, and a suggestive chapter in
Maolear’s Eoidcatial cales cf H. neca.. Part i. ch. 3. pp. 45 ff.
9. majestatis: sc. laesae: ch. 28, ‘laesae augustioris majestatis?
The early Roman law against treason (perduellio) had been extended
in its application by various enactments until, in the time of liberius
(when the sacredness, theoretically ascribed to the state, had become
attached tc the person of the emperor), any act which tended to bring
the commonwealth‚ the lawa, or the emperor into contempt was pun·
iehabic under the charge of majestas. 'l'he professore of Christianity
Ι were liable under the J ulian law of majestas, as members of an illicit
combination3 and, more obviously, as bad subjecte who refused the
customary acts which betolrened loyalty to the emperor and compliance
with the laws; see below, ch. 28: and on the law ostreason, Merivale
