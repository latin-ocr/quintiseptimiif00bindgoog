3. Christo ut Deo. This is the true reading, not ‘et Dec, ’as some
mss. and'edd Pliny’s expression quasi deo, in the passage of which
this is a paraphrase, clearly determines the sense in which he irnder·
stood the Christian worship. A passage in au ancient writer, probably
Hippolytus or Gaius (apud Euseb. v. 28), is equally clear in showing
that the early Christian hymns celebrated the Deity of Christ: ψαλμοὶ ⁴

Θεοῦ τὸν Χριστὸν ὑμνοῦσι θεολογοῦντες. Oomp. origen contr. Gale. viii.

5. rescripsit. On the teohnical use oi this word saa note oh. 4
Tertullian's criticism here oi Trajan’s ruling is strictly a pisce of
forensic pleading: he leaves out ot sight the fact that the profession
of Christianity was a criminal offense previous to the emperor’s rescript
In reality majm’s action was a moderate and statesmanlilre policy of
repr-assion without persecution of what he probably considered was a
dangerom political ammistion. In ch. 5 Tertullian himself claime it
as a sort of check upon the officious enforcemant cf the earlier laws.
